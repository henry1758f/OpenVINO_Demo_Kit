# Inference Engine Demo
## 1. security_barrier_camera_demo
  This demo showcases Vehicle and License Plate Detection network followed by the Vehicle Attributes and License Plate Recognition applied on top of Vehicle Detection results.

## 2. interactive_face_detection_demo
This demo showcases Object Detection task applied for face recognition using sequence of neural networks. Async API can improve overall frame-rate of the application, because rather than wait for inference to complete, the application can continue operating on the host while accelerator is busy. This demo executes four parallel infer requests for the Age/Gender Recognition, Head Pose Estimation, Emotions Recognition, and Facial Landmarks Detection networks that run simultaneously.
